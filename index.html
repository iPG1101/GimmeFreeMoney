<h1>GimmeFreeMoney!</h1>
<h3>Leave this running - this is a bitcoin miner. You can minimize it, and I get paid small amounts of money for free basically. It is very slow becauase it's online, but if I make an extra $0.01 daily, that's more than nothing (*insert shruggie here*)</h3>
<h4>Also, you can straight-up donate BTC: 1FqjH619kJLLixA8nD5kwcMc8nkYYhBiLp - this does cost money though. <s><strikethrough>Do only if you have extra $$$</s></strikethrough> Do as much as you want!</h4>
